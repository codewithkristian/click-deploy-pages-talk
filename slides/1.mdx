# We all know the "table stakes" for Jamstack platforms

---

# "Table stakes"

1. Integrate with Git-based tools (GitHub, BitBucket, etc.)
2. Deploy automatically based on changes to the application
3. Automatically managed infrastructure (CDN, build servers)

---

# Most (if not all) platforms do these things...

---

# What matters now is everything _around_ that core experience

---

# Serverless functions

Deploy easy-to-write, infinitely scalable code to support your site

---

- Cloudflare Workers
- AWS Lambda
- Netlify serverless functions
- Gatsby Cloud functions

---

# Collaborative workflows

Deploy previews, UIs for commenting and remixing in-progress work

# What's next?

---

# The next substantial change in our workflows is...

---

# _Where_ we deploy our applications

---

# Right now

## Your apps are deployed to one of ~30 regions

![AWS](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/aws2.png)

---

# The future

## Region: "The World"

![Cloudflare Edge](http://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_Fy99PIFFym-nobg.png)

---

# Cloudflare's edge servers are around the world

## Deploy <10ms away from most users

---

# Once we're deploying "at the edge", we can do more

---

# Serverless functions won't just live alongside your applications

---

# Serverless functions can run _before_ your applications

---

# Using Workers, we can build powerful APIs and real-time applications that tie _directly_ into our Pages applications

---

# Workers KV: a distributed key-value store at the edge

---

# Workers Durable Objects: always-consistent, addressable objects at the edge

---

# HTMLRewriter: streaming HTML parser & rewriter

---

# We can continue to build more powerful use-cases

- "Edge-side" rendering at the edge
- Personalization/region-based customization
- Low-latency utility functions for things like payments and authentication
- ??? ðŸ¤¯
